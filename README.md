# Algorithms---Data-Structures
Implementations of common algorithms and data structures in C# / C++

This repository was intended as a way for me to practice using C++ to implement common algorithms/data structures found in contest programming.

I also found that it was uncommon to find many C# implementations so I decided to share those as well.
